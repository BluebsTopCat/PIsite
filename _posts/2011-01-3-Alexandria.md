<p class="article">Earlier this week, I had the absolute fortune to fly out to Washington, D.C. for a one-on-one interview with the current Chief Director of the Parahuman Response Team, Rebecca Costa Brown. As Director, she's obviously a very busy woman, but she was gracious enough to answer a few of my questions surrounding policies the PRT has backed, her legacy within the organization, and where she thinks the PRT will go in the future.</p>

<p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Since its codification in 1998, there have been constant controversies surrounding NEPEA-5; namely the difficulties it places on parahumans from seeking non-combative employment. Has there ever been consideration towards repealing the bill? How do you feel about the consequences codifying it had?</p>


<p class="answer">"I'm first among anyone to discuss the downsides of NEPEA. It certainly had consequences, but it's unfair to suggest that the controversies have been constant. We needed a bill like it to ensure that the average person had reasonable avenues to succeed. Despite the flaws, it's necessary because of that. It's almost an anti-monopoly law, if you think about it- just targeted towards parahumans. Just because someone was lucky enough to receive a profitable power doesn't mean that they should get to dominate a market. That's what the bill was intended to do, really."</p>


<p class="question"><b>Q:</b> It goes without saying that you've been a center point of the PRT since its inception. Have you been happy with your tenure as Director? How long do you see yourself holding this position?</p>


<p class="answer">"I've overseen great people doing important things; I wouldn't have done it any other way. Despite the ups and downs of the past decades, we've persisted- and adapted, to suit the needs of the people we serve. And regarding my future, who knows? (laughs) I don't foresee myself stepping down anytime soon, that's for sure. Too many things to do."</p>


<p class="question"><b>Q:</b> With all said and done, what's on the horizon for the PRT? How are you going to adapt to the coming times?</p>


<p class="answer">"Unfortunately, there's not much I can answer here- too much of what I'm currently working on is sensitive. What I can say, though, is we're in communication with a few foreign countries regarding new branches, and that we've been working behind the scenes on lowering response times; President Gillan has been a fantastic supporter of the program, and I'm proud to say that as far as we can see it, our future is a bright one."</p>


<p class="question"><b>Q:</b>Unfortunately, it looks like we're running low on time, so one more quick question: What do you have to say on allegations that the PRT is being operated by some secretive organization?</p>


<p class="answer">"I'm not going to dignify that one with a response."</p>
