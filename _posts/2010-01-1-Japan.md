<p class="article">Three days ago, Japan's National Diet passed a bill dedicated to rebuilding the country's economy. The bill passed with overwhelming support, and features a series of tax breaks and other financial incentives for foreign corporations to operate on Japanese soil. 
<br/><br/>
"No matter how unfortunate times may be, it is our duty to continue restoring our country," said Prime Minister Hitoshi Ohira. "We are not gone, and we will not go- this bill is one of many steps on the way."
<br/><br/>
Similar laws passed in 2001, 2004, and 2009 to little effect, though legislators are optimistic on the impacts that this bill may have.
