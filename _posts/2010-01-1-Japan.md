<p class="article">Three days ago, Japan's National Diet passed an initiative dedicated to rebuilding the country's economy, featuring another sweep of tax breaks and financial incentives for out-of-country corporations.
<br/><br/>
"No matter how unfortunate times may be, it is our duty to continue restoring our country," said Prime Minister Hitoshi Ohira. "We are not gone, and we will not go- this bill is one of many steps on the way."
<br/><br/>
Similar laws passed in 2001, 2004, and 2009 to little effect.
