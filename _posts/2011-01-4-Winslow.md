<p class="article"> Winslow High, a public school servicing much of the northern Brockton area, had to evacuate yesterday following a parahuman attack of unknown origin. 
<br/><br/>At 7:45 am, an even sphere of matter roughly five feet in diameter vanished, cutting through a large swatch of lockers, as well as the wall behind. This attack severed multiple cables run through the space, as well as critical pipes for the area. Upon the power shutting off, chaos erupted in the school.
<br/><br/>
"It was freaky," said one student who preferred to go unnamed. "We were walking to class, when suddenly <i>bam!</i> Everything went dark. Everyone was screaming and running and stuff. I think one pulled out a knife? It was pretty dark though, so maybe not."
<br/><br/>
By the time PRT forces arrived on the scene, the majority of students had already left the building. They escorted the remaining teenagers out, and cordoned off the building for safety. The anomalous zone showed no hazardous qualities, and children were allowed in briefly to collect their books and backpacks. On questioning, the officers were uncertain as to any cause, and were unwilling to comment further.

The attack and resulting upheaval, caused significant damage to school and students. Multiple students were injured, windows were broken, and a section of the first floor received significant water damage from the broken pipes. The school has announced that repairs will take upwards of two weeks, and classes will be cancelled for the duration. Parents have protested, demanding their children receive classes at an alternate location, though the school board has refused.

"It's ridiculous." Said one frustrated parent. "I work full time, and now I'm getting told that my kid has to stay home? I don't have the time to watch them, and I can't afford a babysitter. This is Brockton- letting them go on their merry way is out of the question, and any person who teaches at a place like this should know as much."

The school's administration was not available for comment, though a public statement assured they were working 'as fast as they could.'</p>
